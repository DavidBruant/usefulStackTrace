# usefulStackTrace

A little script to have error 

# Make it work

To have this working:

1. [Allow Scratchpad to run on Chrome](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad#Using_Scratchpad_to_access_Firefox_internals)
1. Open usefulStackTrace.js in scratchpad
1. Choose "browser" in the "Environment" menu (a little thing appears to tell you to be careful)
1. Run the script (Ctrl+R)
1. Let your application throw exceptions! And you'll see a stack trace with files,
line numbers, function names and even function arguments value!

An index.html file is provided for you to test and make sure it works. Follow the steps then clic "Run".
An useful stack trace should be displayed in the console.
